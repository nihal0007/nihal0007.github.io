  <p> And now I'm studying CSE in <a href="http:www.uiu.ac.bd">United International University</a>.</p>
  <p style="color:red;"><font size="5"> My Motivation for studying CSE :</font></p>
  <p> I always had craze on computers and tecnologies. I always wanted to customize apps and games like I want. So, I used to read articales about software development and programing. There I furthur learned about Computer Science and got motivated. So, you can say my motivation for studying in CSE is my curiosity and affection towards computers. CSE also gives us an opportunity to show our creativity. This is also a reason of styding CSE.</p>
